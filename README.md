### Quick Guide to Obtain an API Key from VirusTotal

Visit the VirusTotal Website: https://www.virustotal.com
             
             Open your browser and go to the official VirusTotal website.

Create an Account or Sign In:
             
             If you don't have an account, click on "Sign up" and follow the steps to create a new account.
             If you already have an account, click on "Sign in" and enter your credentials.

Access User Settings:
             
             After logging in, click on your avatar or user icon in the top right corner of the page.
             From the dropdown menu, select "Settings".

Obtain Your API Key:
             
             In the settings page, look for the "API Key" section.
             Your API key will be displayed in this section. If you don't see a key, there may be a "Generate API Key" button you need to click.

Copy the API Key:
             
             Copy the provided API key. This key is unique to your account and will be used to authenticate your requests when using the VirusTotal API.

Store the API Key Securely After Using:
             
             Store the API key in a safe place and do not share it publicly. This key is required to access VirusTotal's API services and should be protected from unauthorized use.
